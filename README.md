Apps, snippets and generally just fooling around with [Puck.js](https://www.puck-js.com/).

### Light Meter
For when you absolutely _must_ know whether or not you're in a dark room. The darker the room, the more frantically the LED will flash!

### Dice Roller
A ~~usability nightmare~~ dice rolling app!
* Hold the button to set the die. After 2 seconds, the LED will flash once per second. Release to set. _(Ex. 6 flashes means a d6 is set)_
* Click the button to roll the die! The LED will flash a random amount of times based on the die type.
